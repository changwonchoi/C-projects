For all cache simulations, use a capacity of 2 KB, and set associativity of 1, for the D-cache.

Sample command line:
pin-fw/pin -injection child -t pin-fw/source/tools/Memory/obj-ia32/dcache.so -c 2 -a 1 -b <block-size> -o <output-file> -- <your-exe>

1.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?

	Data cache misses: 112783
	Data cache references: 641556

1.2 What is the total hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes (give as a %)?
	82.42%

2.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?

	Data cache misses: 20155
	Data cache references: 641556

2.2 What is the total hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes (give as a %)?
	96.86%
	
3.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

	Data cache misses: 16900
	Data cache references: 641556

3.2 What is the total hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes (give as a %)?
	97.37%

4. For this question, assume that the 100,000 element integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory, the size of an integer is 4 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty. As you read the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0, how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is (to be answered without running pin):

a) 4 bytes: 40
	
b) 32 bytes: 5
	
c) 64 bytes: 3
	
5. For this program, which block size is best? Why? What is the relationship between the blocksize and hit ratio? Why?
	64 bytes is the best because it has less misses compared to other block sizes.
	The bigger the blocksize is the bigger hit ratio will be. It is becasue percent miss is defined by min(1, (word size * stride / block size)).

Comparing cache2Drows with cache2Dcols

8. For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory, the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty. As you read the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0], how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of (to be answered without running pin):

a) cache2Drows: 1

b) cache2Dcols: 10

9. Compare the performance (hit ratio) of the D-cache for the 2 programs. Briefly explain what you observe.
	cache2Drows has much better hit ratio than cache2Dcols because cache2Dcols has much bigger stride compared to cache2Drows.
	Going through every single element in each row means that the stride is 1.
	However, going through elements in column-wise order means that the stride is the number of columns, which in this case is 500.
